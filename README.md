# Bench Kona Desktop Edition

This is *very experimental* code used to reverse engineer the Kona drivetrain
items on the bench.

Fully obsolete, to be replaced by a proper embedded module next.

## WARNING

This code is for reference purposes only and is not recommended for use by anyone!

It is demonstrated capable of putting the electric motor into uncontrolled
runaway, and it spoofs safety-critical signals such as indicating that the
charge port is locked when it isn't or that the brake is applied when it is not.
